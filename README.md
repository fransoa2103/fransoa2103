- 👋 Hi, I’m @françois =)
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming since 2020/october but i started coding in 80's with an ATARI 520ST computer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dev back with PHP/MYQSQL & SYMFONY.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work in a team in a company near ALBERTVILLE, CHAMBERY, AIX-LES-BAINS OR GRENOBLE.

`class Profil {
        function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $quality_1, $quality_2, $quality_3, $quality_4,){
                $this->firstName    = $firstName;
                $this->lastName     = $lastName;
                $this->quality_1    = $quality_1;
                $this->quality_2    = $quality_2;
                $this->quality_3    = $quality_3;
                $this->quality_4    = $quality_4;
        }
}

$newCrewMember = new Profil('François', 'Couvé-Bonnaire', 'warm', 'curious','teamSpirit','greatWorker');
echo "Hello i'm ".$newCrewMember->firstName." ".$newCrewMember->lastName."<br/>";
echo "Human profile : ".$newCrewMember->quality_1.", ".$newCrewMember->quality_2.", ".$newCrewMember->quality_3." and ".$newCrewMember->quality_1.".<br/>";
echo "Nice to meet You!";`
